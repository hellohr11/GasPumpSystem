# GasPumpSystem
Software Systems Architectures  
The goal of the second part of the project is to design two Gas Pump components using the Model-
Driven Architecture (MDA) and then implement these Gas Pump components based on this design
using the OO programming language. This OO-oriented design should be based on the MDA-EFSM for
both Gas Pump components that was identified in the first part of the project. You may use your own
MDA-EFSM (assuming that it was correct) or you can use the posted sample MDA-EFSM. In your
design, you MUST use the following OO design patterns:  
state pattern  
strategy pattern  
abstract factory pattern
